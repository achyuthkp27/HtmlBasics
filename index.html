                <h2>HTML Structure</h2>
                <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. An HTML document is composed of three
                    parts: a line containing HTML version information, a declarative header section, a body, which
                    contains the document's actual content.</p>

            <div class="content content-2">
                <div class="fas fa-text-width">
                </div>
                <h2>TEXT</h2>
                <p>HTML document body can be
                    formatted with HTML tags. By formatting, we mean layout and some presentation
                    details. For now, we will ignore the other kinds of content that can appear
                    in an HTML document. Text is often organized into paragraphs in the body of a document.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Images</h2>
                <p>The inclusion of images in a document can dramatically enhance its appearance,
                    although images slow the document-download process. The file in which the
                    image is stored is specified in an element. The image is inserted into the display
                    of the document by the browser.</p>

                <h2>Links</h2>
                <p>A link that points to a different resource specifies the address of that resource.
                    Such an address might be a file name, a directory path and a file name, or a
                    complete URL. If a link points to a specific place in any document other than
                    its beginning, that place somehow must be marked.</p>

                <h2>Lists</h2>
                <br>We frequently make and use lists in daily lifeâ€”for example, to-do lists and grocery
                lists.</br> Likewise, both printed and displayed information is littered with
                lists.</br></br></br></br></br>
                HTML provides simple and effective ways to specify lists in documents.</br> </p>

                </div>
                <h2>Tables and Forms</h2>
                <p>Tables are common fixtures in printed documents, books, and, of course, Web documents.
                    They provide an effective way of presenting many kinds of information.The most common way for a user
                    to communicate information from a Web
                    browser to the server is through a form.</p>

                <h2>Audio and video</h2>
                <p>Audio information is coded into digital streams with encoding algorithms
                    called audio codecs.Video information, like audio information, must be digitized into data files
                    before it can be played by a browser, this time by algorithms called video codecs.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>Time Elements</h2>
                <p>The time element is used to time stamp an article or a document. This element
                    includes both a textual part, in which the time and/or date information can be in
                    any format, and a machine-readable part, which of course has a strict format.</p>

                <h2>Differences HTML and XHTML</h2>
                <p>Case sensitivity. In HTML, tag and attribute names are case insensitive, meaning
                    that FORM, form, and Form are equivalent.</br>In XHTML, tag and attribute
                    names must be all lowercase.</p>
